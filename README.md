## Map Projections
This is an WIP implementation of many map projections as defined in the book
"Flattening the Earth" by John P. Snyder. To view different projections, change
the lines that are marked by comments in the `main.rs` file. To add 
projections, add more mappings in the `projections.rs` file.

Output is stored in a file called `map.png` relative to the current directory.
